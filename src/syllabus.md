CS 4110, "Programming Languages and Logics," is a thrilling amusement-park ride through the beauty and glory of programming languages, the theory behind them, and their implementation. It will not be easy, but you will achieve a clear and rigorous understanding of computing: a rare enlightenment that will give you great power.

# Organization

## Announcements and Q&A: Piazza

We will use a [Piazza][] forum for announcements and communication about the course. Please [sign up for the Piazza instance][piazza]. The course staff will post important updates there that you really want to know about! Check often and enable email notifications.

[piazza]: http://piazza.com/cornell/fall2016/cs4110

You can also ask questions---about lectures, homework, or anything else---on Piazza. The course staff will respond as quickly as possible. It's the most efficient way to get help. If you email the staff directly, we will probably ask you to go through Piazza instead so everyone can benefit from the answer. (Please do email, though, if you have a question that needs to be kept private.)

If you can answer a question yourself, please do! Be careful not to post answers (or parts of answers) to any homework or exam questions. If you're not sure whether something is OK to post, please ask via email.

## Assignments: CMS

You will download homework assignments, upload solutions, and receive grades through [CMS][]. Please log in there to see whether you're in the system. If you're not, please send your NetID to the course staff and we'll get you set up.

[cms]: https://cms-b.csuglab.cornell.edu/

## Feedback

Is the course moving too quickly or too slowly? To help calibrate the pace and content, please fill out the [feedback form][TK] early and often.

## Textbooks, or lack thereof

There will be reading assigned, but there is no textbook.

# Content

## Grading

Final grades will be assigned with these proportions:

* Homework: 50%
* Midterm exam: 20%
* Final exam: 30%

## Problem Sets

Problem sets are due once every two weeks, at 11:59 PM on TK

TK

### Timeliness

You have **two slip days** that you can allocate to problem sets throughout the semester: turn in two assignments one days late, or one assignment two days late, with no penalty. The course staff will tell you when you have used a slip day.

We will **drop one score** to calculate your final grade: that is, your lowest-scoring problem set won't count, even if that score is zero.

Aside from that, late work will not be accepted and will count for zero points.

## Exams

There will be a midterm exam and a final exam.

TK

Makeup exams must be scheduled within the first two weeks of class. Check the schedule now to see if you have a conflict with another class and contact the instructor immediately to reschedule.

# Policies

## Academic Integrity

Absolute integrity is expected of all Cornell students in every academic undertaking. The course staff will prosecute violations aggressively using automatic detection tools.

You are responsible for understanding every word of these policies:

- <a href="http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Cornell University Code of Academic Integrity</a>
- <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/ugrad/CSMajor/index.htm#ai">Computer Science Department Code of Academic Integrity</a>

You can also read about the [protocol for prosecution of violations][aiproceedings].

[aiproceedings]: http://www.theuniversityfaculty.cornell.edu/AcadInteg/index.html

On **problem sets**, everything you turn in must be 100% completely your own work. You may discuss with other students about requirements for the assignment, general techniques that will be useful, programming in OCaml, etc. But when it comes to developing specific answers or coding, you may not talk to other students or anyone else. Specifically:

* Do not show any partial solution to another student or give any hints.
* Never share code. (Shared code is surprisingly easy to detect.)
* Do not search the Internet for solutions.
* *Do* ask someone if you're confused about what the assignment is asking for.
* *Definitely* ask the course staff if you're not sure whether or not something is OK.

Here's the policy for **exams**: You may not give assistance to anyone or receive assistance of any kind from anyone at all during an exam. All exams are closed book.

You may not give any hints or post any code that might be part of a solution on Piazza.

If you are unsure about what is permissible and what is not, *please ask*!

## Respect in Class

Everyone---the instructor, TAs, and students---must be respectful of everyone else in this class. All communication, in class and online, will be held to a high standard for inclusiveness: it may never target individuals or groups for harassment, and it may not exclude specific groups. That includes everything from outright animosity to the subtle ways we phrase things and even our timing.

For example: do not talk over other people; don't use male pronouns when you mean to refer to people of all genders; avoid explicit language that has a chance of seeming inappropriate to other people; and don't let strong emotions get in the way of calm, scientific communication.

If any of the communication in this class doesn't meet these standards, please don't escalate it by responding in kind. Instead, contact the instructor as early as possible. If you don't feel comfortable discussing something directly with the instructor---for example, if the instructor is the problem---please contact the advising office or the department chair.

## Special Needs and Wellness

It is university policy to provide reasonable accommodations to students who have a documented disability (e.g., physical, learning, psychiatric, vision, hearing, or systemic) that may affect their
ability to participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact <a
href="http://sds.cornell.edu">Student Disability Services</a> at
607-254-4545, or the instructor for a confidential discussion of their
individual needs.

If you are experiencing undue personal or academic stress at any time during the semester or need to talk to someone who can help, contact the instructor or:
